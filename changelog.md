## Version 2.0

Version 2.0 is a major release.

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
  IMPORTANT 1: In 2.0, there is no more the distinction between the `Spotter` and the `Indexer` phases. They have been merged into one unique highly configurable `Termino` pipeline.  
</div>

#### Broken until 2.1

* Graphical User Interface

#### New Features

* Added support for Mate POS Tagger and Lemmatizer (`en` and `fr` only) in addition to TreeTagger.
* Major refactoring of TermSuite's data model. See [[TermSuiteDataModel]]
* Simplified TermSuite Type system (see [[TermSuiteDataModel]] for details)
* Dropped all UIMA XML resource description. Moved to uimaFit completely.
* Splitted the huge TermSuite's Gradle multi-project config into separate and independant Github/Maven projects.
* Published TermSuite and all its dependant subprojects as Maven artefacts.
* Moved source code and documentation to Github and Github's wiki.
* Added AE primary occurrence detector.
* Added AE for term class grouping.
* Added AE for producing tsv variant evaluation files.
* TSV Export AE made configurable. (you can select the Term properties you want to get in your TSV)
* Added Morphology analysis. (with CompostAE)
* Improved syntactic variant resources + supportfor morphosyntactic variants detection.
* Improved and debugged Weirdness Ratio (old specificity) computing (`GeneralLanguage.*` resources being retrained on larger corpus with new TermSuite standards)
* Migrated syntactic variant resources from `*.groovy` to `*.yaml` (beatter readability + improved rule indexing and more efficient rule matching detection)
* Added JSON Serializing for terminologies. Now terminologies can be saved into `*.json` and loaded from `*.JSON`.
* Terminology export in `*.xmi` format in not supported anymore. (`*.xmi` terminology files were too big, not human readable, and Exporter/Parser were too slow)
* Added several `JUnit` tests for several AEs and intelligent helper methods.

## Version 1.6

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
  IMPORTANT : The new default encoding for TreeTagger resource interpretation in TermSuite is UTF-8. Please make sure that all your TreeTagger models are UTF-8 encoded.
