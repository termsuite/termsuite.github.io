Example of prefix variations in french: (TermSuite support for language `en` will come in Sep. 2016)

```
machine synchrone
  - machine asynchrone
contrôle direct
  - contrôle indirect
```

```
génération d'électricité
  - génération électrique
étude de l'environnement
  - étude environnementale
pâle grivée
  - givrage de pâle.
```

### Agenda: TermSuite 3.0

TermSuite 3.0 is planned for december 2016. New expected features are:

 * migration to Java 8 (Java 7 will be abandonned),
 * support for term semantic variations (synonyms, antonyms, etc),
 * built-in POS tagging support (no need for an external tagger anymore, which will ease the installation).
 * Extension of linguistic specification for derivates and prefix variation to `en` and all languages
