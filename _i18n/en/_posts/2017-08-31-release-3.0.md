TermSuite is a software for terminology extraction and multilingual term alignment. TermSuite is developped by [LS2N group](http://ls2n.fr/) at [University of Nantes](http://www.univ-nantes.fr/), and is currently supported by the French National Research Agency (CNRS) under grant ANR-10-IDEX-0004-02 and contributes to the project [ISTEX](http://www.istex.fr/), led by INIST.

Latest version of TermSuite (currently 3.0.10) and its documentation are accessible on the official site:

[http://termsuite.github.io/](http://termsuite.github.io/)

Major changes in version 3.0 are:

 * detection of semantic (mainly synonymic) term variants,
 * improved detection of term variants on longer terms, (variation inference)
 * italian support,
 * a new graph-based terminology data model,
 * a new Java API,
 * a better coverage of TermSuite's features by command line API,
 * an improved post-processing of extracted terminologies  based on graph-based algorithm,
 * documentation improved (theoritical information, better output format documentation...)

Any issue with TermSuite should be reported at [https://github.com/termsuite/termsuite-core/issues](https://github.com/termsuite/termsuite-core/issues) (preferred) or by email termsuite@univ-nantes.fr. Any question related to TermSuite can be addressed to termsuite@univ-nantes.fr.
