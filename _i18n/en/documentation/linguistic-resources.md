### Terminology extraction

For Terminology extraction, you need several different resources for each language. Fortunately, these resources can all be downloaded at once as a single TermSuite resource pack :

<a href="{{site.resources.jar}}" class="btn btn-success" role="button">{{site.resources.filename}}</a>
{:class="text-center"}

See more information about TermSuite resources on Github project [termsuite-resources](https://github.com/termsuite/termsuite-resources).

### Multilingual term alignment

For multilingual term alignment, you need:

 * two TermSuite terminologies (as `json` files, the source termino and the target termino). Such terminologies are the outputs of TermSuite [terminology extraction pipelines]({{site.baseurl}}/documentation/command-line-api/#termino) processed on domain-specific corpora,
 * a bilingual dictionary.
